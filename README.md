In this repository you can find the Python code to replicate the analysis of our work regarding the impact of route randomization on the urban sustainability.


## Abstract

Routing algorithms typically suggest the fastest path or slight variation to reach a user's desired destination. Although this suggestion at the individual level is undoubtedly advantageous for the user, from a collective point of view, the aggregation of all single suggested paths may result in an increasing impact (e.g., in terms of emissions).
In this study, we use SUMO to simulate the effects of incorporating randomness into routing algorithms on emissions, their distribution, and travel time in the urban area of Milan (Italy). Our results reveal that, given the common practice of routing towards the fastest path, a certain level of randomness in routes reduces emissions and travel time. In other words, the stronger the random component in the routes, the more pronounced the benefits upon a certain threshold. Our research provides insight into the potential advantages of considering collective outcomes in routing decisions and highlights the need to explore further the relationship between route randomization and sustainability in urban transportation.


## Setup

## How to install and configure SUMO (Simulation of Urban MObility) 🚗🚙🛻

### Install SUMO

Please always refer to the [SUMO Installation page](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Installing/index.html)
for the latest installation instructions.

#### > Windows

To install SUMO on Windows it is necessary to download the installer [here](https://sumo.dlr.de/docs/Downloads.php#windows) and run the executable.

#### > Linux

To install SUMO on Linux is it necessary to execute the following commands:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sumo/stable
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install sumo sumo-tools sumo-doc
```

#### > macOS

SUMO can be installed on macOS via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).

You can install and update Homebrew as following:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install.sh)"
brew update
brew install --cask xquartz
```
To install SUMO:
```
brew tap dlr-ts/sumo
brew install sumo
```


### Configure SUMO

After installing SUMO you must configure your `PATH` and `SUMO_HOME` environment variables.

Suppose you installed SUMO at `/your/path/to/sumo-<version>`

#### > Windows
1. On the Windows search box search for "Edit the system environment variables" option and open it;
2. Under user variables select `PATH` and click Edit. If no such variable exists you must create it with the New-Button; 
3. Append `;/your/path/to/sumo-<version>/bin` to the end of the `PATH` value (do not delete the existing values);
4. Under user variables select `SUMO_HOME` and click Edit. If no such variable exists you must create it with the New-Button;
5. Set `/your/path/to/sumo-<version>` as the value of the `SUMO_HOME` variable.

#### > Linux

1. Open a file explorer and go to `/home/YOUR_NAME/`;
2. Open the file named `.bashrc` with a text editor;
3. Place this code export `SUMO_HOME="/your/path/to/sumo-<version>/"` somewhere in the file and save;
4. Reboot your computer.


#### > macOS

First you need to determine which shell (bash or zsh) you are currently working with. In a terminal, `type ps -p $$`.

##### ZSH

In a Terminal, execute the following steps:

1. Run the command `open ~/.zshrc`, this will open the `.zshrc` file in TextEdit;
2. Add the following line to that document: `export SUMO_HOME="/your/path/to/sumo-<version>"` and save it;
3. Apply the changes by entering: `source ~/.zshrc`.

##### bash

In a Terminal, execute the following steps:

1. Run the command `open ~/.bash_profile`, this will open the `.bash_profile` file in TextEdit;
2. Add the following line to that document: `export SUMO_HOME="/your/path/to/sumo-<version>"` and save it;
3. Apply the changes by entering: `source ~/.bash_profile`.
